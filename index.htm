<pre> Wanted to make someting a little more personal for you and try the web design thing myself as maybe you could get a laugh or appreciativeness for my effort in this new side of technology. 
took me a little bit of time to get used to it but it is pretty damn fun playing around. Especially if it's for you!</pre>

<p> I cannot imagine, think of, or creat a person that i could love more. Your different views to me show me how stupid i can sometimes be and how much i have to rethink about myself and my opinions. 
in life, you make me do other things as well. go out more, expreince the world and do things i would normally not do. and i know i do the same to you. You also showed me how to truly study and become
a studious student making sure all my work is of good value and quality. every one of our differences has helped me be a better person and still continues to do so. I know that im not perfect, and i have had a lot 
of time to think about myself and see my faults in a much more clearer light than before, becasue you showed them to me. I also know, that my love was not always perfect, i put you in situations where you did not know what to
do and were helpless. I didn't express my love as much in the last weeks as i should have because i simply took you for granted. this wont ever happen again. You are the love of my life and im sure of it. 
I am and will continue todo everythng in my power to get your love back and for you to expreince mine once again. I cannot and will not live without you. Johnny.
<br>

<b>i miss you so much</b>
